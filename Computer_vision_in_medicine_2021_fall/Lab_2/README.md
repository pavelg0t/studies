**Main goal of this lab assignment:** Check the hypothesis that the first convolutional layer in an object detection model performs edge detection among other feature extraction tasks.

**Our tasks:**

1. Analyze learned kernel weights of the first convolutional layer in the SSD head detection model. Carry on a convolution operation on an example image using the retrieved kernel weights sand analyze the results.
2. Run a simple edge detection model based on Sobel filter using TensorFlow functional API. Test it on few example images to see the basics of edge detection.
